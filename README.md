# Research Questions

This is a crowd-sourcing tool for peer review of essay theses and research
questions. It allows students to anonymously submit their proposals for
in-depth review by their peers.

### Setup

This application is built on Python and Django, and styled using Bootstrap
& Bootswatch (customized for GMU).

To get started, you will need to install the Python dependencies listed in
`requirements.txt`. Running the platform is as easy as running Gunicorn to
start the app and pointing a web server (Apache, Nginx) at your python
server.

### ToDo

* Include comment functionality on index page allowing users to skip the discussion step.
