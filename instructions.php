<h1>Instructions</h1>

<p>
  The objective of this exercise is to have you rate your peers' research
  questions as either <strong>good</strong> or <strong>needs work</strong>.
  You will also be asked to provide <strong>comments</strong> explaining your
  thought process. This document is meant to help you understand how best
  to do this.

<h1>Research Questions</h1>

<a name="Good-Questions"></a>
<h2>Good Questions</h2>

<p> The art of constructing a good research question is a difficult skill
to learn, but with persistence and dedication can be mastered in a short
span of time. A good research question is not something that can be written
in a single sitting.  This process requires careful planning, critical
analysis of your chosen topic and revisions based on the feedback you will
receive.</p>

<p>Once you have chosen an acceptable research topic, it is time to write
your research question. When beginning to write the question, keep in mind
the following factors: </p>

<a name="Uniqueness"></a>
<h3>Uniqueness</h3>

<p>Your research question should be unique - this means that either no one
has previously asked this question or that your work presents a new line of
thought on an existing controversy.</p>

<a name="Framing"></a>
<h3>Framing</h3>

<p>The best research questions look at the "hows" and "whys" rather than
the "whats" and "whos." On occasion, a good research question can begin
with "what" (or even more rarely with "who") if it meets all the other
necessary criteria.</p>

<p>You do not want to have a question that can definitively be answered.
The answer to your research question should be debatable. A question asking
"who" or "what" can almost always be answered conclusively, and therefore
is not a proper research question.</p>

<a name="Focus"></a>
<h3>Focus</h3>

<p>Your research question should be asking a specific question that is
narrow. For example, <em>"How did President Clinton's Foreign Policy
Towards Southern Europe in the Late 1990s Help America?"</em> is too broad.
What part(s) of America will you be discussing in the paper? What exact
time period does <em>"the late 1990s"</em> constitute?  What do you
consider to be the boundaries of Southern Europe? You do not have to
provide all of these answers in your research question, but you should
consider them as you attempt to make your question more specific. A better
research question, using our example, would be, <em>"How did President
Clinton's foreign policy towards Southern France and Northern Italy between
1995 and 1999 influence the economy in America’s Northeast?"</em></p>


<a name="Completeness"></a>
<h3>Completeness</h3>

<p>Remember that your research question should include the following four
components – who, what, where and when. In our example of a good research
question (see bullet four), the who is "<em>President Clinton,"</em> the
where is both "<em>Southern France and Northern Italy"</em> and
"<em>America’s Northeast,"</em> the when is "<em>between 1995 and
1999"</em> and the what is "<em>President Clinton’s foreign policy."</em>
You do not need to neessarily include every component specifically in the
question; for example, you could have used "<em>late 1990s"</em> in place
of "<em>between 1995 and 1999."</em> However, at some point in your paper
you would need to clarify what you consider to be "<em>late
1990s."</em></p>


<a name="Researchability"></a>
<h3>Researchability</h3>

<p>Make sure your research question has enough available scholarly sources
for you to write a research paper (although this should have been confirmed
when choosing your research topic).</p>

<a name="Example-Questions"></a>
<h2>Example Questions</h2>

<h3>Needs Improvement: <em>"Who killed President John F. Kennedy?"</em></h3>

<p>Although the answer to this question is debatable, it is too broad and
uses "who" instead of "why" or "how." In order to improve the question, the
topic needs to focus more closely on one aspect of JFK's assassin(s) and
provide more details in the question.</p>

<p><strong>Improved:</strong> <em>"Why do modern historians continue to
debate the ‘lone gunman theory’ of the JFK Assassination?"</em></p>

<p><strong>Improved:</strong> <em>"How did the secrecy of the Warren
Commission establish a foundation for theories of conspiracy concerning the
JFK Assassination?"</em>

<h3>Needs Improvement: <em>"Will Hillary Clinton run for President in
2016?"</em></h3>

<p>This question is far too broad - there are many possibilities that can
be explored - and the scholarship on this subject is likely limited, as it
is a very recent topic. In order to improve this question, a student should
focus on a topic that is at least a few years old and is more specific.
Also, keep in mind that while looking toward the future may be fine as an
aspect for the paper, it can prove difficult to focus an entire paper
around predicting the future.</p>

<p><strong>Improved:</strong> <em>"How can the errors made in Hillary
Clinton's 2008 Presidential Campaign be analyzed in order to improve the
success of future candidacies?"</em></p>

<p><strong>Improved:</strong> <em>"How did Hillary Clinton's loss in the
2008 Democratic Iowa Caucus create a domino effect that led to the
Presidency of Barack Obama?"</em></p>


<a name="Feedback"></a>
<h1>Feedback</h1>

<p>So, you and your classmates have completed the colossal task of creating
your research questions. Unfortunately, a question that may make sense to
you may not make sense to everyone else. This is why peer reviewing each
other’s proposed questions is an absolute necessity. In order to arrive at
the perfect research question, it is imperative to heed the constructive
criticism of others and to adjust your question accordingly each time.
Allow suggestions from others as well as the information you gain from
scholarly articles guide your research process.</p>

<a name="Constructive-Feedback"></a>
<h2>Constructive Feedback</h2>

<p>First of all, it is very important to note that <strong><em>positive
feedback isn't always good and negative feedback isn't always
bad</em></strong>.  Remember that the purpose of providing feedback isn't
to make your classmate feel better about their research projects; it is to
help them do better with their research projects.</p>

<p>Good feedback encourages the researcher, but also pushes them to improve
their question by letting him/her know what may be unclear to others.</p>

<p>Look at the question critically and identify where improvements could be
made in order to make the question more specific and answerable. Offer
these suggestions in your feedback. It is always better to offer an
alternative phrase or word in order to make it clear to the researcher
exactly how they can improve the question.</p>

<a name="Non-Constructive-Feedback"></a>
<h2>Non-Constructive Feedback</h2>

<p>Just like a bad research question, bad feedback is vague and unhelpful.
Feedback is least useful when it is dishonest, biased, too critical, or
unspecific. Be as honest as possible to the researcher to allow them to
make changes wherever possible. Never hold back constructive criticism for
fear of hurting your classmate's feelings. Instead, do them a favor and
help them create the best question they can! Always remember to tell them
exactly where and how they can make improvements to their question, but
always remember to praise them for what they did right.</p>

<a name="Feedback-Example"></a>
<h2>Feedback Example</h2>

<p>If your classmate's question is, <em>"Who killed President John F.
Kennedy?"</em></p>

<p>You may offer good feedback by first letting them know that this
question may be too broad for them to complete their research project in a
timely manner. Let them know that while this question is debatable as a
good research question should be, it is slightly unfocused. Propose a
certain detail surrounding JFK's assassination that they should focus on in
order to streamline their research and produce a good paper.</p>

<p><strong><em>Do not</em></strong> tell the researcher that this is a good question
if you are aware that it is not. This type of positive feedback is
dishonest, and dishonest feedback is always bad feedback. Your main aim
should be to help your peers improve the way that you’d like them to help
YOU improve.</p>

<a name="Pro-Tip"></a>
<h2>Pro Tip</h2>

<p>Listen to the feedback you receive. If your question is unclear to one
of your peers, chances are it may also be unclear to others. Be mindful of
the fact that your peers are not out to get you, but that they want to see
you succeed. Never be afraid of asking for feedback, and do not become
discouraged if the feedback you receive is not what you would have hoped.
You are all in the same Honors 110 boat, and by giving and receiving honest
feedback, you are setting yourselves up for nothing short of success.</p>
