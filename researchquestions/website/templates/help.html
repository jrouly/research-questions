        <h1>Writing Analytical Research Questions</h1>

        <p>The art of constructing an analytical research question is a
        difficult skill to learn, but with persistence and dedication it
        can be mastered in a short span of time. An analytical research
        question is not something that can be written in a single sitting.
        Rather, an analytical research question is the result of a
        sustained processâ€”a process that requires careful planning, a
        developed knowledge of your chosen topic, and constant revision. To
        help you get started, this page provides information about the
        <em>Types of Questions</em> you can and should ask about a topic
        and warns you about some common <em>Mistakes to Avoid</em> when
        composing a good analytical research question.</p>
