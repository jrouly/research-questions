  <h2>Constructive Feedback</h2>

  <p>So, you and your classmates have completed the colossal task of creating
  your research questions. Unfortunately, a question that may make sense to
  you may not make sense to everyone else. This is why peer reviewing each
  other’s proposed questions is an absolute necessity. In order to arrive at
  the perfect research question, it is imperative to heed the constructive
  criticism of others and to adjust your question accordingly each time.
  Allow suggestions from others as well as the information you gain from
  scholarly articles guide your research process.</p>

  <p>First of all, it is very important to note that <strong><em>positive
  feedback isn't always good and negative feedback isn't always
  bad</em></strong>.  Remember that the purpose of providing feedback isn't
  to make your classmate feel better about their research projects; it is to
  help them do better with their research projects.</p>

  <p>Good feedback encourages the researcher, but also pushes them to improve
  their question by letting them know what may be unclear to others.</p>

  <p>Look at the question critically and identify where improvements could be
  made in order to make the question more specific and answerable. Offer
  these suggestions in your feedback. It is always better to offer an
  alternative phrase or word in order to make it clear to the researcher
  exactly how they can improve the question.</p>

  <h2>Non-Constructive Feedback</h2>

  <p>Just like a bad research question, bad feedback is vague and unhelpful.
  Feedback is least useful when it is dishonest, biased, too critical, or
  unspecific. Be as honest as possible to the researcher to allow them to
  make changes wherever possible. Never hold back constructive criticism for
  fear of hurting your classmate's feelings. Instead, do them a favor and
  help them create the best question they can! Always remember to tell them
  exactly where and how they can make improvements to their question, but
  always remember to praise them for what they did right.</p>

<div class="tab-pane fade" id="FeedbackExample">
  <h2>Feedback Example</h2>

  <p>If your classmate's question is, <em>"Who killed President John F.
  Kennedy?"</em></p>

  <p>You may offer good feedback by first letting them know that this
  question may be too broad for them to complete their research project in a
  timely manner. Let them know that while this question is debatable as a
  good research question should be, it is slightly unfocused. Propose a
  certain detail surrounding JFK's assassination that they should focus on in
  order to streamline their research and produce a good paper.</p>

  <p><strong><em>Do not</em></strong> tell the researcher that this is a good question
  if you are aware that it is not. This type of positive feedback is
  dishonest, and dishonest feedback is always bad feedback. Your main aim
  should be to help your peers improve the way that you’d like them to help
  YOU improve.</p>

<div class="tab-pane fade" id="ProTip">
  <h2>Pro Tip</h2>

  <p>Listen to the feedback you will receive. If your question is unclear
  to one of your peers, chances are it may also be unclear to others. Be
  mindful of the fact that your peers are not out to get you, but that
  they want to see you succeed. Never be afraid of asking for feedback,
  and do not become discouraged if the feedback you will receive is not
  what you would have hoped.  You are all in the same Honors 110 boat,
  and by giving and receiving honest feedback, you are setting yourselves
  up for nothing short of success.</p>
