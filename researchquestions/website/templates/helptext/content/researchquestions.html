  <h2>Research Questions</h2>

  <p>The art of constructing a good research question is a difficult
  skill to learn, but with persistence and dedication it can be
  mastered in a short span of time. A good research question is not
  something that can be written in a single sitting. This process
  requires careful planning, critical analysis of your chosen topic,
  and revisions based on the feedback you will receive.</p>

  <p>Once you have chosen an acceptable research topic, it is time to
  write your research question. When beginning to write the question,
  keep in mind the following factors:</p>

  <h3>Originality</h3>

  <p>Your research question should be unique. This means that either
  no one has previously asked this question or that your work
  presents a new line of thought on an existing controversy.</p>

  <h3>Focusing On Specific Details</h3>

  <p>Your research question should be asking a specific question that
  is narrow. For example, <em>"How did President Clinton's Foreign
  Policy Towards Southern Europe in the Late 1990s Help
  America?"</em> is too broad.  What part(s) of America will you be
  discussing in the paper?  What exact time period does <em>"the late
  1990s"</em> constitute? What do you consider to be the boundaries
  of Southern Europe? You do not need to provide all of these answers
  in your initial research question, but you should consider them as
  you attempt to make your question more specific. A better research
  question, using our example, would be, <em>"How did President
  Clinton's foreign policy towards Southern France and Northern Italy
  between 1995 and 1999 influence the economy in America’s
  Northeast?"</em></p>

  <h3>Perform a Self-Check on Your Question</h3>

  <p>Remember that your research question should include the
  following four components: who, what, where and when. In our
  example of a good research question above, the who is
  <em>"President Clinton,"</em> the where is both <em>"Southern
  France and Northern Italy"</em> and <em>"America’s Northeast,"</em>
  the when is <em>"between 1995 and 1999"</em> and the what is
  <em>"President Clinton’s foreign policy."</em> You do not need to
  necessarily include every component specifically in the question;
  for example, you could have used <em>"late 1990s"</em> in place of
  <em>"between 1995 and 1999."</em> However, at some point in your
  paper you would need to clarify what you consider to be <em>"late
  1990s."</em></p>

  <h3>Is There Enough Material to Research Your Question?</h3>

  <p>Make sure your research question has enough available scholarly
  sources for you to write the paper (although this should have been
  confirmed when choosing your research topic).</p>

  <h2>Improving Your Questions</h2>

  <h3><em>"Who killed President John F. Kennedy?"</em></h3>

  <p>Although the answer to this question is debatable, it is too
  broad and uses <em>"who"</em> instead of <em>"why"</em> or
  <em>"how."</em> In order to improve the question, the topic needs
  to focus more closely on one aspect of JFK's assassin(s) and
  provide more details in the question.</p>

  <p><strong>Improved:</strong> <em>"Why do modern historians
  continue to debate the ‘lone gunman theory’ of the JFK
  Assassination?"</em></p>

  <p><strong>Improved:</strong> <em>"How did the secrecy of the
  Warren Commission establish a foundation for theories of conspiracy
  concerning the JFK Assassination?"</em>

  <h3><em>"Will Hillary Clinton run for President in 2016?"</em></h3>

  <p>This question is far too broad - there are many possibilities
  that can be explored - and the scholarship on this subject is
  likely limited, as it is a very recent topic. In order to improve
  this question, a student should focus on a topic that is at least a
  few years old and is more specific.  Also, keep in mind that while
  looking toward the future may be fine as an aspect for the paper,
  it can prove difficult to focus an entire paper around predicting
  the future.</p>

  <p><strong>Improved:</strong> <em>"How can the errors made in
  Hillary Clinton's 2008 Presidential Campaign be analyzed in order
  to improve the success of future candidacies?"</em></p>

  <p><strong>Improved:</strong> <em>"How did Hillary Clinton's loss
  in the 2008 Democratic Iowa Caucus create a domino effect that led
  to the Presidency of Barack Obama?"</em></p>

  <h3><em>"How did Barack Obama become President?"</em></h3>

  <p>This question needs to be more specific, and as with the
  previous example, the scholarship on this subject may be limited,
  as it is a very recent topic. At this point in time, focusing on a
  previous president would lead to better sources and academic
  research for your paper.  Also, keep in mind that while topics
  encompassing modern politics are covered in a variety of sources,
  not all of these materials may be considered scholarly or
  peer-reviewed (The New York Times and The Washington Post are
  acceptable sources for this paper, but the bulk of your research
  should come from peer-reviewed journal articles or academic
  texts).</p>

  <p><strong>Improved:</strong> <em>"How was Barack Obama able to use
  his victory in the 2008 Iowa Caucus to win the Democratic Party
  Nomination for President of the United States?"</em></p>

  <p><strong>Improved:</strong> <em>"Why was the 2008 Democratic
  Party Presidential Primary electorate so enthusiastic about the
  candidacy of Barack Obama after his victory in the Iowa
  Caucus?"</em></p>
