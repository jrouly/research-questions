  <h2>Submitting a Question</h2>

  <p>Submitting a question is simple. Click the "Submit Question"
  link in the navigation bar at the top of the screen, then enter
  your research question or topic in the provided box and hit submit.
  That's all!</p>


  <h2>The Comment System</h2>

  <p>The comment and reply system on each student's question allows
  for pseudo-anonymous discussion. Please use comments and replies to
  discuss a student's proposed idea, and provide them with
  constructive feedback or ideas.</p>


  <h2>Usernames</h2>

  <p>You will be paired with a randomly generated username when
  engaging in discussion. The usernames are generated from a list of
  English adjectives and nouns. If you find your username offensive,
  please report it to an <a
  href="mailto:jrouly@gmu.edu">administrator</a>.</p>


  <h2>Student Accountability</h2>

  <p>Despite having anonymized usernames for discussion, you are
  still held accountable for content posted. Moderators (including
  your PRMs, GTAs, and professors) have access to your secret
  identities. If you post objectionable content, you <em>will</em> be
  held accountable. This can include, but is not limited to: personal
  attacks, slurs, "trolling," and general rudeness.</p>
